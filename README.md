## Description

This git repository contains a collection of specfiles that are
used by Fedora's COPR build service to produce nightly rpm packages
for Fedora.

## How do I install these formulae?

```
dnf copr enable dciabrin/ngdevkit
dnf install ngdevkit ngdevkit-gngeo
```

Have a look at the [ngdevkit repository](https://github.com/dciabrin/ngdevkit)
for a detailed documentation on how to install those packages and use them to build
and run some example ROMs.
